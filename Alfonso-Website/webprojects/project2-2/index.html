                <p>Bullying is when a person or group repeatedly tries to harm someone who is weaker or who they think is weaker. Sometimes it involves direct attacks such as hitting, name calling, teasing or taunting. Sometimes it is indirect, such as spreading rumors or trying to make others reject someone.</p>

            <h1>Our Mission Statement</h1>
        
            <p>The primary mission of Stop Bullying Now Foundation, Inc. is to raise money for school districts around the country to address and eliminate the ongoing dangerous student bullying problem which is causing death, much mental and physical harm as well as forcing students to drop out of school. These school districts do not have the funds to address this important problem because of budget cuts due to deficits.<br><br>
            Stop Bullying Now Foundation, Inc. will aggressively address the bullying problem and the high dropout rate among students. The dropout rate is causing an increase in local crime at a large expense to the taxpayers. The bullying problem is causing hardship to other students and their families.
            <br><br>
            We will also utilize media advertising, which is important to alert the public about this out of control epidemic.
