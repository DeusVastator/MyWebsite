            <p>For this project everyone had to write a script in their group. We all voted on which script to use to make a video and mine was chosen. This is a story about people and their silly phobias. I have uploaded the bloopers of this video on my youtube channel if you want to see our hilarious attempts at acting.

            <p>This was the first video production I have done since high school when I had tv production class. Everyone had a copy of the raw footage and edited their own version of it. This is the version I edited for the project, it shows how music/sound effects can help silent videos tell a story. The title text in each cut was a requirement for the project so that is why they are there.</p>

            <p>This is the logo I made for the business card modified with a light from adobe after effects. It was more of a personal project but I added it as an extra credit we could attempt for our final in Intro to digital media. I'm completely new to after effects so this was my first poor attempt.</p>

            <p>This is an intro video I'm working on for a friend who live streams and uploads videos to youtube. It is still a work in progress but I have high hopes that over time I will improve in after effect and perfect this project for him.</p>
